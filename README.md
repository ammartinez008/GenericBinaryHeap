# GenericBinaryHeap
## Generic Binary Heap Data Structure with Mix and Max type heap distinction

Implements basic functionality including:
- insert: inserts an element of T type
- remove: removes the root element 
- size: returns size of current heap
- peek: returns the root element

#### Interfaces
Heap: defines the heap interface
HeapType: defines the type of Heap, either min or max

#### How to Use
- Instantiate a MinBinaryHeap if you want to use Minimum binary heap
- Instantiate a MaxBinaryHeap if you want to use a Maximum binary heap

#### Example
Example of how to use MaxBinaryHeap or MinBinaryHeap are contained in Solution.java
